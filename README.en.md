## Features

### Display Modes

Two display modes available, configurable via `agCockpit.displayMode`:

#### Webview Dashboard

![Dashboard Overview](assets/dashboard_card_grouped.png)

- **Card View**: Card layout for quota overview
- **Grouping Mode**: Aggregates models by quota pool
- **Non-Grouping Mode**: Shows individual model quotas
- **Drag-and-Drop Sorting**: Reorder cards by dragging
- **Auto-Grouping**: Automatically categorizes models by quota pool

#### QuickPick Mode

![QuickPick Mode](assets/quickpick_mode.png)

Uses VS Code native QuickPick API, suitable for:
- Environments where Webview cannot load
- Users who prefer keyboard navigation
- Quick quota checks

Features:
- Supports grouping / non-grouping mode
- Title bar buttons: Refresh, Toggle Grouping, Logs, Settings, Switch to Webview
- Pin models to status bar
- Rename models and groups

---

### Status Bar

Displays quota status of monitored models. 6 formats available:

| Format | Example |
|--------|---------|
| Icon only | `🚀` |
| Dot only | `🟢` / `🟡` / `🔴` |
| Percent only | `95%` |
| Dot + Percent | `🟢 95%` |
| Name + Percent | `Sonnet: 95%` |
| Full display | `🟢 Sonnet: 95%` |

- **Multi-Model Pinning**: Monitor multiple models simultaneously
- **Auto-Monitor**: Shows the model with lowest remaining quota when no model is pinned

---

### Quota Display

Each model / group shows:
- **Remaining quota percentage**
- **Countdown**: e.g., `4h 40m`
- **Reset time**: e.g., `15:16`
- **Progress bar**: Visual representation of remaining quota

---

### Quota Source (Local / Authorized)

Two quota sources are available, and you can switch from the top-right of the panel at any time:

- **Local Monitoring**: Reads from the local Antigravity client process; more stable but requires the client to stay running
- **Authorized Monitoring**: Fetches quota via authorized remote APIs, independent of the local process; ideal for API relays or headless usage
- **Multi-account Authorization**: Authorized monitoring supports multiple accounts with account switching and status badges
- **Switching Tips**: Shows loading/timeout hints during switches; you can switch back to local if the network is unstable

---

### Model Capabilities Tooltip

![Model Capabilities Tooltip](assets/model_capabilities_tooltip.png)

Hover over model name to view:
- Supported input types (text, image, video, etc.)
- Context window size
- Other capability tags

---

### Grouping Feature

- **Group by Quota Pool**: Models sharing quota pools are grouped automatically or manually
- **Custom Group Names**: Click edit icon to rename
- **Group Sorting**: Drag to reorder groups
- **Group Pinning**: Pin groups to status bar

---

### Settings Panel

![Settings Modal](assets/settings_modal.png)

Open via gear icon in dashboard header. Configure:
- Status bar display format
- Warning threshold (yellow)
- Critical threshold (red)
- View mode (card / list)
- Notification toggle

---

### Profile Panel

Displays:
- Subscription tier
- User ID
- Collapsible, sensitive data can be masked

---

### Notifications

Sends notifications when model quota falls below warning threshold or is exhausted. Can be disabled in settings.

---

## Usage

---

---

### Auto Wake-up

**NEW** 🔥 Schedule automated requests to wake up AI models and trigger quota reset cycles.

- **Flexible Scheduling**: Supports daily, weekly, interval, and advanced Crontab modes
- **Multi-Model Support**: Wake up multiple models simultaneously
- **Multi-Account Authorization**: Authorize multiple accounts, switch active account, and view account status
- **Account Management**: Manage accounts with reauthorize/remove actions
